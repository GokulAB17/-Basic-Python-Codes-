# Loop : Repeating the code again and again until the statement is True OR condition is True.

# Inorder to reduce the complexity, more efficient,increase the speed of the code execute.

# Loops allows the execution of the statement OR a group of statements for more mutiple times.
    
# Once the condition becomes False,it stop the execution and comes out & control moves out of loop.

# Loops support : while,for and Nested.
    
# While Loop : It will execute until the Iteration of the statement OR argument is True.
    
# For Loop: It will executes the given iteration statement for specified number of times.
    # The boolean condition.
    # The initial value of the counting variable.
    # Incrementation of counting variable.
